## Introduction
#### We will be working with two data that share a common variable: country. The first dataset shows cost of living indexes per country and the second shows population statistics per country. Since it can be easily hypothesized that there is a relationship between urbanized popoulations and cost of living, the study of these two datasets should offer insight on the relationship between population status and costs of living. These relationships will be viewed through the lens of the demoggraphic transition model; each stage in the demographic transition model has its own characteristic population status. There are 5 stages. At stage 1 there is the lowest overall population and the highest death rate. As a country progresses to stage 5, population increases, and death rate is lower. The rate of population increases rapidly from 2 to 3 but then only increases slowly from stage 4 onward. This increase in population is supported by a country's ability to acquire and distribute resources to its population.

```
#### The mean % Urban Pop is above half. This is expected as global populations have been shifting to more urban societies. 
```{r sd}

```
#### Variance among Cost of Living index is 338.74. This is reflective of different economic statuses of countries as well as their differing demographic stages. 
```{r n}

  # get distinct vals for population, rent and groceries index, urban pop %, fertility rate, and pop density.
  summarise(distinct_vals_COL = n_distinct(Cost.of.Living.Index, na.rm = TRUE),

  # use kable to make table
  kbl() %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = 'Arial') %>% kable_material()
```
#### Some countries did not have data for population 2020 so they failed to be considered for distinct values. As well, fertility rate has fewer unique values since the measurement scale is more discrete than Urban population percentage, for example.
```{r quantiles}
pop_cost %>%
  
  # get quantiles for population, rent and groceries index, urban pop %, fertility rate, and pop density.
  summarise(quantile_COL = quantile(Cost.of.Living.Index, na.rm = TRUE),

            quantile_rent_index = quantile(Rent.Index, na.rm = TRUE), 
            quantile_groceries_index = quantile(Groceries.Index, na.rm = TRUE),

# For the quantile table, the first row is at 0% followed by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% percentiles.
```
#### Quantiles for population density are very spread out ranging from 3 persons per square kilometer to 21645. This is reflective of countries in different development stages; as a country urbanizes, population tends to concentrate around urban centers and thus population density grows. 
```{r mins}
pop_cost %>%
  
  # get minimum vals for population, rent and groceries index, urban pop %, fertility rate, and pop density.
  summarise(min_COL = min(Cost.of.Living.Index, na.rm = TRUE),

  kbl() %>%

```
#### The min fertility rate is 1.1 which means for that country, the average woman will bear 1 child if she were to live to the end of her child-bearing years. Typically, countries in more developed demographic stages see lower fertility
```{r max}
pop_cost %>%
  
  # get max vals for population, rent and groceries index, urban pop %, fertility rate, and pop density.

```
#### Max population is 1.4 billion. This is typical for countries that have historically had a high fertility rate.

```
#### Mean Cost of living is higher for countries that bring more migration in. Though this may be counterintuitive, recall that more developed countries, which posess such costs of living, typically have pull factors such as better economic opportunity to yield more income.

```
#### Standard deviation for population for countries with a net out migration is considerably higher than that for net in migration countries. Since countries that bring migrants in tend to be more developed, their populations are more stable compared to their developing counterparts.

```
#### Overall, distinct values are close to their respective n count. This is because the nature of these statistics is such that many of them are continuous numeric variables (such as urban pop %) while the discrete numerics measure large numbers which can vary greatly from one another.

#### 1. Population density has a weak positive cor with rent index.
#### 2. Fertility rate has a weak neg relationship with CoL, % urban pop, Rent. This is characteristic of developing     countries.
#### 3. Interestingly, there is a negative cor between Population and Net Migration.

```{r plot 2}

  # filter by in countries

  # pop will be measured in milions
  ggplot(aes(x = Urban.pop, y = Pop.2020/1000000)) +

```
```{r plot 3}

  # filter by out countries

  geom_point(size = 4, color = 'blue') 
```

#### As reflected in the correlation matrix, there is little to no correlation between % urban pop and population. However, from the countries with a net in migration, the points are more concentrated towards a higher Urban Pop. %. This is reflective of the correlation between Urban Pop. % and Net migration.

```{r scree}
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)

# create pca
pca <- pop_num %>%
  # scale the mean and variance to zero
  scale() %>%
  prcomp()

# variance percentage
perc <- (pca$sdev^2/sum(pca$sdev^2))
#make scree plot
fviz_screeplot(pca,linecolor = 'red', barfill = 'green') + 
  labs(title = 'Visualization of Eigenvalues')

get_eig(pca)
head(pca$rotation)
```
#### Column 1 and 2 have eig > 1 with a total variation > 5%. The cumulative proportion of variance between PC1 and PC2 > 80%, thus, cost of living and rent index satisfy all 3 conditions of Kaiser's rule.

#### The positive correlation between urban pop % and cost of living is reflective of development and urbanization influences on a country's population. As well, Fertility Rate had a negative correlation with Urban Pop % which reflects the earlier demographic stages' high population growth but low development.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
